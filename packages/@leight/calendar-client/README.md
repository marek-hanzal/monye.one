# @leight/calendar-client

This library is general-purpose Calendar component (not a date picker) used to render Gregorian calendars. It's quite a feature rich and
based on a great [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) library for styling (and integration) as this was on of the motivations for creating this library.

## Documentation

Documentation and working examples can be [found here](https://leight-core.github.io/viv/docs/packages/calendar-client).

## Credits

I just want to give huge credits to [Luxon library](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) which serves as a backend for this calendar stuff and is fully integrated into `@leight` packages.
